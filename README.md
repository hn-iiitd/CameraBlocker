# Camera Blocker Browser Extension


## Overview

The **Camera Blocker** browser extension is designed to enhance your online privacy by giving you full control over your webcam access. With a simple and intuitive interface, you can easily enable or disable camera access for all websites. This extension acts as a virtual camera shutter, providing peace of mind and preventing unauthorized use of your camera.

## Features

- **Intuitive Interface**: A large, easy-to-use slider button to manage camera access.
- **Real-Time Status**: Displays the current status of camera permissions, so you always know whether your camera is accessible.
