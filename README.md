# CameraBlocker
The Camera Blocker browser extension is a lightweight and user-friendly tool designed to give users control over their webcam access across all websites. Inspired by the need for enhanced privacy and security, this extension allows users to quickly enable or disable their camera with a simple toggle button, acting as a virtual camera shutter.
